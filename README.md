#### Rules

You are playing as a girl trying to get thru life. The goal is to avoid boys for as long as you can.
Everytime you make it to the bottom of the screen you score one victory. Watch out though, everytime 2 boys
successfully catch you they tell another boy and they are added to try and catch you. To make matters worse after
every three successfull trips to the bottom of the screen an evil heart will be added. Not only will you have to avoid boys,
but now you will have to ward off serious relationships. After 10 successfull trips to the bottom of the screen you are victorious!
If you are caught 15 times then the game is over, you lose. 2 kids, a dog and a mini-van may be in your future.
